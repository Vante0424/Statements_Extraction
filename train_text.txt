<headline>Greenpeace: Platzeck blocks energy turnaround</headline>
<text>Potsdam (ots) - Today Greenpeace activists protest against the climate-damaging direction of the Brandenburg prime minister Matthias Platzeck (SPD) on closed meeting of the SPD leadership in front of the island hotel Hermannswerder in Potsdam. The activists pile uo 20 tons of lignite on the approach road and hold a banner "Dear SPD. Platzeck's lignite blocks the energy turnaround". In its concept of eneragy strategy 2030.the red-red government of Brandenburg still put on lignite which is the most climate-damaging energy source.
"The actual concept of energy strategy leads in a impasse for climate policy", says Greenpeace's energy expert Anike Peters."It is a mistake to think that there will be an European infrastructure for carbon dioxide and in the same way lignite will be burnt.
Prime minister Platzeck harms his country, if he continues to ignore the advantages of the phase-out of lignite. Renewable energy could generate more jobs and bring a greater value added into the country", says Peters.
Greenpeace demands Mr.Platzeck to extend period for a statement to six weeks, as soon as it is possible to view the complete content of any related studies.
